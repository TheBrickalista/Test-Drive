# Test-Drive Demo

This is a small practice repository (“Test-Drive”) containing a simple Python script that opens a colored window with the text **“Test Drive”** centered in it. It uses the Tkinter library, which is included in the Python standard library.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (Tkinter comes bundled with most Python distributions).  
2. In your terminal, navigate to this repo’s root directory.  
3. (Optional) It’s best practice to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
